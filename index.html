                    <p>First and foremost, welcome to my personal Portfolio. This is my first attempt at creating a static Portfolio, using HTML, CSS and JavaScript, with the purpose to introduce myself and to showcase some of my work and side projects that are software related. I have included media queries to allow this webpage to be viewed correctly on various mobile and tablet devices.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>My name is Joe Bentley, I am 27, and I recently changed career from being a professional dancer in hope to find employment in the tech industry. Dancing was always my passion from a young age it took me all over the world, performing in many countries and on cruise ships. Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, I took the lockdown period to self teach some new skills and with the help of friends and family I discovered a new passion - Software Development.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>I have recently graduated from an intensive bootcamp: Master Code course with Code Nation. A fully remote learning course, which taught me many new tech and social skills within the tech industry.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>In addition to dancing and developing, I am an enthusiastic Welsh Evertonian, with an avid passion for video games and sports.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Please take this time to browse my Portfolio and projects, checking out my social network platforms via the social media icons, my credentials via the attached CV and feel free to contact me via email or the contact form.</p>

                    <div class="text">Creative skills</div>
                    <p>From the age of 8 years old, I have followed a path of theatrics, pursuing a career in dance. My training consisted of hard work, commitment and dedication to the arts. Along my journey I have developed not only a life on stage, but a full range of social and team work skills as well. From being a Dancer in a cast team, to Dance Captain and Showteam Leader furthered my experience of team work and team management in order to meet the requirements and high levels of performances expected.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>I have had the pleasure of spending numerous years working on cruise ships, which saw me in many new countries, which enhanced my experience of new cultures and working alongside colleagues from other backgrounds. The creative and social skills I have gained from my previous career has set me up with a lifetime of expertise that I will carry into my next chapter.</p>

                    <p>As most modern day developers, I started my introduction to Software by studying the foundations of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. With the help of online resources, I was able to grasp an idea of the functionality of Software Development.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>I embarked on my bootcamp Master Code course with Code Nation, September '20 where I was taught in depth the power of <b>JavaScript</b>, a wider range of elements I could use in <b>HTML</b> and even more creative aesthetics with <b>CSS</b>. As the weeks went by, we were introduced to a new framework - <b>React.</b> From then on I have always had a keen insight into the functionality and fluidity of how React works and to this moment, I still favour React as my preferred framework.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Looking at the <b>MERN</b> (Mongo, Express, React, Node) stack, it was a little overwhelming at first, but after further study and work using Mongo and Express, our team were able to build a fully functioning fullstack app. I enjoyed working on the backend with Mongo, and linking the front and backend together using Express.</p>
                    <br><br>
                    <p class="read-more-wrap">Around week 9 of the Bootcamp, we looked at <b>Python</b> and <b>Django.</b> A brand new language for me where I grasped the 'easy to write + read' syntax and powerful practicality. Using Python and Django, our teams were able to build fullstack apps. I thoroughly enjoyed working with Django and how productive the built in admin resource was.
                    <br><br>
                    <span class="read-more-target">During the entirety of the course, we learnt and used helpful tools to assist us with our projects. With the introduction to <b>Docker</b>, I was able to understand the use of containers and images and the functionality of connecting them to a Database. Using an application called <b>Insomnia</b>, I was able to test backend code quickly and efficiently. In order to meet industry expectations, we used <b>GitKraken</b> to comply with our Git repositories. This was an essential skill, as it was necessary when working with teams, in order to know who was working on what and to review then approve pull requests when a file was completed before merging.
                    <br><br>
                    I graduated from Code Nation in December '20 having completed 12 weeks of intense learning. I am grateful for the curriculum taught but also for the other skills I developed along the way. Through apps such as <b>Slack</b>, communication and team work were vital in order to meet deadlines and to successfully achieve the criteria. From lightning talks and retro presentations, these are skills that have also benefitted me.<br>I now aim to better myself further through more self study to push my knowledge and capabilites to a higher level.
